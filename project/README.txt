The directory "schiphol_flights_chrome_extension" contains, as itâ€™s name implies a Chrome Extension.

Due to the fact the extension has not been released (yet) in the Chrome Web Store, you need to install it manually.

You can do this by opening the Chrome Browser, and going to the menu button. Then click on  Extra -> Extensions.
In the upper right corner there is a checkbox labeled "Developer modus". You need to activate the checkbox.

Then, go to Load unpacked extension, and browse to the "schiphol_flights_chrome_extension" directory. The extension will be loaded, so now you can test it.

The extension features heavy use of JavaScript/jQuery and even includes basic flight update notifications. Please test it thorougly.
